# bootloop_MagTagLib
This is for a bug report, I need to upload my bmp

If you take my pihole.bmp in a command like 'magtag.graphics.set_background("/bmps/pihole.bmp")' my MagTag Bootloop (without error message).


To test, I used this learn guide code in the github.
Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides-master\MagTag_Quote_Board

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides

This is with 6.1.0.beta2 and the lattest library bundle with on top of it the lattest MagTag library.
